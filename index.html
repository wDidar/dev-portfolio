            <p id="personal">I've been a battle droid since I was created but am tired of constantly fighting in wars,
                being
                destroyed, fixed, and sent back. This is why I am now trying to bring some variety into my life by
                mastering
                web development.</p>

                enough to even teach
                fellow droids. I dream of teaching all my fellow droids and saving them from boredom.</p>

                <p>I have mastered all coding languages and can make a website incredibly efficient. I can handle all
                    aspects of developing a website; such as servers, security, design, function. I can solve any
                    problem or
                    create any website for you.</p>

                <p>Due to a lack of experiece, nobody was willing to accept me. I still made websites for some companies
                    and
                    presented it to them, asking for feedback. This experience truly opened my eyes and gave me what I
                    needed to get a job.</p>
